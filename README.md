# Tic-Tac-Toe AI
Developed an AI that plays tic-tac-toe and can't be defeated. Implemented using the minimax algorithm. Project part of CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python.

## Installation

Install `pygame` using the following command 
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## More about the project

This is an adversarial search AI implemented using the minimax algorithm, that allows the AI to play optimally against it's opponent. It works by checking all the available actions and selecting the most optimal one. 

Each action can have one of the three values: `1`, `0` and `-1`.

`-1` means the O player has won the game.

`0` means the game ended in a draw.

`1` means the X player has won the game.
